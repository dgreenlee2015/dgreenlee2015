# Dustin Greenlee

I am a Security Analyst at Northwest Missouri State University. I have a degree in Cyber Security and working on my masters in Applied Computer Science.

Through my classes I have created several repositories for assignments.

My proudest repository is where I and three others created a working game in godot in three months.

I am currently working on my own game where one day I may get to publish it.

I enjoy board games, video games, disc golf, and spending time with my family.
